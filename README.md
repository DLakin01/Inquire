##Inquire Chat - A Slack Replica Built in Angular

_Technologies used: AngularJS, Firebase, Git, Bootstrap, others_

**About the Project**

Inquire Chat is all about conversation. Built on AngularJS and hooked up to the cloud via FireBase, this app is modular, lightweight, and easy to use. Users can create their own profiles that are authenticated through FireBase, open new chatrooms, and start conversations that can go on forever! Inquire is a Single Page Application, reducing load times and server calls. All the information is brought over from the server right at load, and is filtered and displayed to the view as necessary at the controller level

Here's some pictures of Inquire in action:

**From page load, users are treated to an easy and fun experience.**

The app has evolved considerably since its beginning. I was unsatisfied with a barebones chat service, and decided to integrate emojis, time filters, and a CSS-driven design that makes conversations a pleasure to look at as well as engage in. Inquire will continue to improve over time as I learn more and integrate new functionality, but for now, it's ready for your next conversation!

Inquire Chat is currently hosted on Heroku, and can be seen [here.](https://inquire-chat.herokuapp.com)
